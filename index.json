    "keywords": "How to add functionality to the generated UI prefab? The plugin only contains a minimal set of functions for now. You may need to implement a more complex UI for your project. Fortunately, you can do that while still benefiting from this plugin. Localization, multilingual support Currently, the plugin does not contain built-in support for language localization. However, you can add your language options to the plugin. To offer translations for your action names, you need to edit the Input Rebinder Action . This class has a name in a TextMeshPro field which you can set when you swap languages. You would need to attach a new component to the root of the prefab Input Rebinder Template to keep a dictionary of translations. To offer translations for binding names, there is currently no easy way. Since the plugin relies on Unity's input system for interactive listening, language support for device names and control names depends on Unity. I doubt there is non-English language support for bindings. Miscellaneous game events Your game design may involve subverting the user while they are using the UI. For example, you can trigger a game event when the user clicks the close button or any button. Usually, the game event is the sound of clicking a button. For each button in the prefab, you can find its related game object in the hierarchy by clicking on the button in the scene view. Then you can add listeners to the click event."

    "title": "How to customize the appearance of the generated prefab | Input Rebinder 1.0.0 documentation",
    "keywords": "How to customize the appearance of the generated prefab In almost every game, the default appearance of the generated prefab is not suitable for your aesthetic. Your game may have a theme that requires a certain color palette and font palette. The prefab generated by Input Rebinder is customizable just like any Unity game object. There are two ways to modify the appearance. Modify the generated prefab variant Modify the prefab templates used by the plugin Modifying the generated prefab variant This way of modifying the prefab is straightforward. You can treat the prefab just like any other game object in your scene. The downside is that you would have to repeat the process each time you need to generate a new prefab, e.g because your .inputactions file has changed. To avoid repetition, you should only modify the prefab after your game control design has been settled. However, if iterating over controls is needed, you should modify the plugin's prefab templates . ⚠️ WARNING : If you generate the prefab again, the default appearance will overwrite your current prefab variant and all its changes. To avoid this, you should rename your prefab variant on disk, set another name inside the plugin's editor window, or detach your scene instance from the prefab completely. Bring the prefab into a scene Drag the prefab variant from the project explorer to the scene hierarchy. You can then click on the prefab children game objects to modify them. Examples of modifiable objects Description of actions Each action is held by an Input Rebinder Action prefab, under the corresponding Action Map prefab, which in turn is placed inside the Displayed Map Scroll View . Every action is paired with an empty slot for a potential description. You can edit the underlying text. You can adjust the size and position of the text and its box. Order of appearance of actions It is possible to modify the order in which things are displayed. Each action and binding pair are arranged sequencially under an action map . The original order is determined by the order of your .inputactions file. You can move an action with all its bindings by selecting all pairs between the action and next action. To move them in the hierarchy, Unity requires you to be inside a prefab view. ⚠️ WARNING : If you don't move the binding pairs with the action, the presentation will be messy. Although each binding will work individually and still connect to the correct action, your user will be confused. Order of appearance of bindings Similar to actions, bindings can be arranged in a custom order. All bindings come in pairs . Each pair may contain 1 or 2 bindings. You may shuffle the order of pairs within an action, the order of bindings within a pair, or exchange bindings between pairs. The original order of bindings is determined by your .inputactions file. Unity may require you to go inside a prefab view to move the bindings around. ⚠️ WARNING : It is possible to move a binding pair outside of its corresponding action. Modifying the prefab templates used by the plugin This way of modifying the prefab is indirect and more complicated. However, this method will make the plugin generate prefabs in your aesthetic all the time. The prefab templates are in the folder Packages/Input Rebinder/Runtime/Prefabs . Currently, there is no way of saving your aesthetics for future use. Therefore, if a package update is attempted, your modified prefab templates will get overwritten. Examples of changes Change the background color of a binding To change the background color of a binding, you can open the prefab of a binding . Then you can change the background color of the root game object."

    "href": "manual/Getting_Started.html",
    "title": "Getting Started | Input Rebinder 1.0.0 documentation",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Importing To import this package in your project, you need to use Unity's package manager (\"Window\" > \"Package Manager\"). From there, follow the instructions for your situation. If the package is already on your disk, click \"Add package from disk...\". Otherwise, you need to acquire the package from the Asset Store. Generate an in-game UI Step 1 Go to \"Tools\" > \"Input Rebinder\". This will open the editor plugin's window. Step 2 On the opened editor window, select your .inputactions file. This is a file that Unity generates when you use the Input System. To select, click the rounded symbol with a dot inside. Note : The Input Rebinder plugin comes with some .inputactions file, namely Empty and One . They are used for testing only. Step 3 In Generated Prefab Folder , select where you want the prefab to be generated in your project. By default, it is \"Assets/Prefabs\" and it will create the folders if they don't exist. Step 4 In Generated Prefab Name , write the name of the prefab that will be generated by the Input Rebinder plugin. By default, the name is \"Input Rebinder Controls\". Step 5 Click Analyse . Step 6 Pick which actions and action maps you want the plugin to generate. Usually, the UI action map is deselected because you don't want players to change the in-game UI's event system. Step 7 Click Generate . A prefab variant is generated at your desired location. A prefab variant is an instance of another prefab that is instantiable by itself. You may detach the prefab variant after you have finished using the plugin. Step 8 Place the generated prefab into a scene. Click 2D in the editor to see in-game UI instead of the 3D world. Step 9 To integrate your game, there are many ways and it depends on you. For example, you may disable the prefab and write a script that enables the generated prefab when a game event occurs. Or you may place the generated prefab alone in a scene that is switched into. By default, the Close button on the prefab disables the root of the prefab. You can modify its behavior by changing its attached listener in the inspector."
